# DocuVeeb: UI Documentation for Excel VBA 

DocuVeeb provides a tool and process for automated documentation of VBA code, along the lines of Doxygen for C++ or JavaDocs for Java. It is geared towards an API or library of procedures, for describing the UI for those procedures.

You still have to write the documentation (this isn't AI), but DocuVeeb will take your notes and create an integrated set of HTML pages. It will optionally also create a project for Windows HTML Help Workshop, for a Windows Help file.

DocuVeeb fills the gap Microsoft created by not providing such a tool along with the VBA IDE.

## Getting Started

The procedures used in DocuVeeb are of course documented using DocuVeeb. An easy way to get a sense of the process is to run the tool. Set the output project path as needed on the Parameters page, execute, and inspect the HTML output against the input tags in the VBA. Note that this is not a UI per se, but it does make a good example of the process.

The process is spelled out in detail in the accompanying Word doc.

## Getting Help

Currently in the process of setting up support website. 

## Created By

DocuVeeb was created by Dr. Richard Cook. It has been in use internally with clients for 7-8 years, and is now ready for release to the general coding public. 

## Future Development

The target is to expand coverage to other types of VBA projects, not limited to Excel only.
